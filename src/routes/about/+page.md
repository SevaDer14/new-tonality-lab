# About

Have you ever wondered why the 12 notes we use in music are such as they are? Why major triad sounds pleasant and diminished triad sound dissonant? If yes, so did I. As a physicist, I also never found usual explanation of dissonance being related to simple ratios convincing. So I dug deeper until I stumbled upon a work of [William Sethares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sethares) on xentonality in the book ["Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215646583_Tuning_Timbre_Spectrum_Scale). Beautiful idea that musical tuning emerges from inner structure of a single note really made sense to me, so I was very surprised on how little this idea is known among musicians. 

New Tonality project is aimed to popularize and advance ideas laid out by Sethares in his book. Some theory is covered on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@new_tonality) and for practical stuff, check out [xen-tonal additive synthesizer](/lab) to start experimenting with xen-tonality. It is in the early stage of active development, you can follow updates on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/newtonality) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/new_tonality). Also feel free to contribute to the development on [Github](https://github.com/SevaDer14/new-tonality-lab).
